Lumahunter is a simple tool to count your random encounters, while you are hunting a specific temtem. You simply start the tool, add your temtem and start hitting ("PLUSKEY") to count. The program can run in the background. The progress is saved in .txt file, so for Streamers interesting (OBS can read txt files and show them in stream).
